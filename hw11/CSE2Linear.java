 /*Write a program called CSE2Linear.java that prompts 
 the user to enter 15 ints for studentsâ€™ final grades in CSE2. 
 Check that the user only enters ints, and print an error message 
 if the user enters anything other than an int.  
 Print a different error message for an int that is out of the range from 0-100, 
 and finally a third error message if the int is not greater than or equal to the last int.  
 Print the final input array. 
 
 Next, prompt the user to enter a grade to be searched for. 
 implement a binary search to find the entered grade. 
 Indicate if the grade was found or not, and print out the number of iterations used. 
 
 Next, scramble the sorted array randomly, 
 and print out the scrambled array.
 \Prompt the user again to enter an int to be searched for, 
 and use linear search to find the grade. 
 Indicate if the grade was found or not, 
 and how many iterations it took. 
 
 Enter 15 ints for final grades in CSE2: 
14 35 39 48 56 76 78 84 86 88 89 90 91 93 94 
The grades, sorted, are: 14 35 39 48 56 76 78 84 86 88 89 90 91 93 94 
Enter a grade to search for: 81
81 was not found in the list with 4 iterations

Scrambled: 
89 48 56 76 91 39 90 78 84 86 93 94 14 35 88 
Enter a grade to search for: 48
48 was found in the list with 2 iterations
